      <p id="this-is-an-id">Milestone 1 (1950's)</p>
    <p>One of the big milestones that came with computers was in the 1950’s when there were 8 different things that happened during that time period but I’m just going to talk about the few main one’s. One of those was when CSIRAC played Colonel Bogey March. Programmer Geoff Hill demonstrated CSIRCA during the first Australian Conference on Autonomic Computing machines in which he programmed it to play the Colonel Bogey which was a regimental march written in World War 1. Another big event that happened was the J.Lyons and Company introduced the LEO-1. The LEO-1 was England’s first commercial computer and was performing useful work before any other commercial computer system in the world. It was doing this by delivery cakes to hundreds of Lyon tea shops across the world. Also The Robot Squirrel was invented during this time period. The Robot Squirrel is a machine that uses two light sensors and two contact switches to hunt for ‘’nuts’’ and drag them to their nest. The Robot Squirrel was conceived by computer pioneer Edmund Berkeley, who earlier wrote the hugely popular book Giant Brains or Machines That Think (1949).<p>

   <p id="this-is-an-id">Milestone 2 (1970's)</p>
        <p>The 1970’s was also a huge milestone for computers and technology. I say this for a few reasons. One of those reasons is because banking automation finally reaches customers. This is significant because in the 1950’s they were still trying to revolutionize behind-the-scenes checks. During the 1960s researchers in various countries have been working on bringing automation – and online transactions – to customers in the form of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Barclays Bank in the UK has likely been the first to put one in operation, in 1967. By decade’s end many systems are up or being planned in Europe and North America. The paper used by some of the first ATMs is slightly radioactive, to be machine readable. In the 1970s is where you will see rapid growth in behind-the-scenes financial transaction networks, like SWIFT for wire transfers. This is important because we still use ATMs all the time even to this day. Another important event is that Pascal is introduced. The Pascal programming language, named after Blaise Pascal, a French physicist, mathematician and inventor turned philosopher, is introduced by Professor Niklaus Wirth. His goal with Pascal was to create a programming language applicable to both commercial and scientific applications, and which could also be used to teach programming techniques to college students. It was closely based on ALGOL 60, which Wirth had also helped to develop.<p>

          <p id="this-is-an-id">Milestone 3 (1980's)</p>
          <p>The 1980’s was also a huge milestone for computers and technology. One of the main reasons I say this because IBM begins to introduce its personal computer (pc). IBM's brand recognition, along with a massive marketing campaign, ignites the fast growth of the personal computer market with the announcement of its own personal computer (PC). The first IBM PC, formally known as the IBM Model 5150, was based on a 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 microprocessor and used Microsoft´s MS-DOS operating system. The IBM PC revolutionized business computing by becoming the first PC to gain widespread adoption by industry. The IBM PC was widely copied (“cloned”) and led to the creation of a vast “ecosystem” of software, peripherals, and other commodities for use with the platform. Also a huge event that took place was the U.S National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) starts up. U.S. Internet protocols (TCP/IP) get a major boost when the National Science foundation forms the NSFNET, linking five supercomputer centers at Princeton University, Pittsburgh, University of California at San Diego, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Cornell University. Soon, over a dozen regional and educational networks will be added, including BITNET, CSNET, and a dozen or so others. Parts of the original ARPAnet had been reassigned to NSFNET, while others had gone to the military network, MILNET. The NSFNET is a major factor in helping Internet protocols win out over rival protocols like OSI, SNA, and DECNET.

    <p id="this-is-an-id">Milestone 4 (1990's)</p>
    <p>The 1990’s was also a huge milestone for computers and technology. One of the main reasons I say this is because Magneto-Optical Discs begin to be introduced. Housed in cartridges, they are a combination of magnetic and optical storage, as their name suggests. They could be rewritten up to one million times. Faster than CD/RWs and DVD-RAMs, M-O discs used lasers that heated up the bits on the disc, after which a magnet would change the bit's polarity according to what was being written, thereby storing the information. Microsoft ships Windows 3.0. Compatible with DOS programs, the first successful version of Windows finally offered good enough performance to satisfy PC users. For the new version, Microsoft updated the interface and created a design that allowed PCs to support large graphical applications for the first time. It also allowed multiple programs to run simultaneously on its Intel 80386 microprocessor. Microsoft lined up a number of other applications ahead of time that ran under Windows 3.0, including versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. As a result, PC users were exposed to the user-friendly concepts of the Apple Macintosh, making the IBM PC more popular.<p>

     <p id="this-is-an-id">Milestone 5 (2000's )
      </p>
      <p>The 2000’s was also a huge milestone for computers and technology. One of the main reasons I say this is because the first phone camera is introduced. Japan's SoftBank introduces the first camera phone, the J-Phone J-SH04; a Sharp-manufactured digital phone with integrated camera. The camera had a maximum resolution of 0.11 megapixels, a 256-color display, and photos could be shared wirelessly. The J-Phone line would quickly expand, releasing a flip-phone version just a month later. Cameras would become a significant part of most phones within a year, and several countries have even passed laws regulating their use. Also during this time period the USB flash drive would be created. Sometimes referred to as jump drives or memory sticks, these drives consisted of flash memory encased in a small form factor container with a USB interface. They could be used for data storage and in the backing up and transferring of files between various devices. They were faster and had greater data capacity than earlier storage media. Also, they could not be scratched like optical discs and were resilient to magnetic erasure, unlike floppy disks. Drives for floppy disks and optical discs faded in popularity for desktop PCs and laptops in favor of USB ports after flash drives were introduced.  <p>
